What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git creates a repository keep track to of the different versions of files in the current working directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area only includes the files for which we want to track changes in a single commit. It allows user to choose which files to include in a commit, rather than every files in the directory.
	Working directory will shows all files in the directory. It doesn't interact with the act to creating a new commit.
